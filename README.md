# Unit-3-Project

## Description

Welcome to our Github repo! This project is designed to revolutionize that way people find gifts for those that are hard to shop for! Our application is built with the focus of an easy to use interface and allow users to access listings for that perfect item from a link supplied by the creator. Users can create items and lists based on categories to help the next person not have to scoure the internet for that great gift!

Here is our application in action:

As you can see, our application is user friendly and easy on the eyes. This application really will help making gift hunting that much easier. Once logged in you can Create a New list, once you create that list you can go to home page and choose the list that you created once picked you can add gifts to that list. If we dont have a gift you want you can go to Create New Idea and there you can add the name,img,url, category and description. Once done it will be added and can be added to lists. It will also be viewable in the category that you choose. All the categories above are based on big gift giving days. When you click on your username there you can choose to edit the name of your lists or delete them. Under the my ideas section under your username you will find that you can edit the gifts added as well.

Feel free to explore our repo, ask questions, and provide suggestions! We love you

## Unsolved Issues

We could have added even more depth to this application.

## Future Enhancments

In the future we hope to have more list's available to consumers from our catagories;as well as the abilty to click to share lists and items to anyone using any traditional shareing way. Whether that would be on socials, email, text, ect. A ranking system for our lists would also be an interesting feature to show highest rated to lowest rated.
